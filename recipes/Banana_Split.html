    <p>A lovely summer cake that requires no cooking. This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- Learned my own way to delete empty lanes from a paste text command
        and paste the text lines into <li> elements quickly. First make the parent ul/ol
        and paste the data below the opening tag, make sure the closing tag is
        2 lines below the end of the text, now use the shortcut alt+shift and select
        all the text making sure only text lines get a cursor, then use End key to move
        the cursors and press Del Key once,now Shift+Home and Cut the text. The cursors
        will remain in place, and so will their lines, create <li> tag on all cursors
        simultaneously, place the cursors inside the tags, paste the text and Voila!!! Yayyy!!!-->
